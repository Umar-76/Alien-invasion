# Alien Invasion - Arcade Shooter Game

## Overview
This project is a simple **arcade shooter game** created in Python using the **pygame** module.

## Bugs & Issues
If you encounter any bugs, feel free to mention them in the **Issues** section.

## How to Get Started
You can **clone this repository** to have your own version of the game or contribute to its development!

### **How to Play**
1. Install Python.
2. Go to **Releases** and download the `AlienInvasion.rar` file.
3. Extract the file.
4. Inside the `AlienInvasion` folder, **double-click** `AlienInvasion.exe` to play.

### **Controls**
- **Movement**: Use the arrow keys (**Left, Right, Up, Down**).
- **Shooting**: Press the **Spacebar**.
- **Start / Restart the game**: Press **'P'**.
- **Quit the game**: Press **'Q'**.

## Conversion to Executable
This entire project is converted into an executable file using **auto-py-to-exe**, a GUI tool for converting Python scripts into standalone applications.

## Acknowledgment
The game itself is **not originally created** by me. Instead, I made my own version based on the game mentioned in the book _"No Starch Python"_, which serves as a beginnerâ€™s guide to Python.

## Troubleshooting
If the extracted version does not run or shows the error **"pygame module not found"**, install pygame using:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
or
```bash
pip3 install pygame
```
